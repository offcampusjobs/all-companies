Top 10 Fresher Interview Questions with Sample Answers
Tell me about yourself.
I am a recent graduate in Computer Science with strong fundamentals in programming and problem‑solving. I have worked on projects like a real‑time multiplayer Sudoku app and a recommendation system, which helped me apply concepts practically. I enjoy learning new technologies and am actively looking for opportunities to contribute to real‑world software development.
Walk me through your projects.
One of my key projects is a real‑time multiplayer Sudoku application built using React, Express, and Socket.IO. I handled backend logic, game state management, and real‑time communication. Another project is a diabetic food recommendation system using Rasa, which improved my understanding of AI-based conversational systems.
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
My strengths include problem‑solving, backend development, and learning new things quickly. A weakness I am working on is sometimes taking too much time to perfect minor details, but I am learning to balance speed and accuracy.
Why should we hire you?
You should hire me because I have strong technical fundamentals, hands‑on project experience, and the ability to learn quickly. I bring fresh ideas, a strong work ethic, and enthusiasm to contribute to the team.
Explain OOP in simple words.
OOP stands for Object‑Oriented Programming. It organizes code into objects that contain data and behavior. Its four pillars—Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism—help make code reusable, modular, and easy to maintain.
What is your favorite programming language and why?
My favorite language is JavaScript because it allows full‑stack development, has a huge ecosystem, and supports building everything from websites to real‑time applications.
Describe a challenge you faced and how you solved it.
During my multiplayer Sudoku project, managing real‑time synchronization between players was challenging. I solved it by creating a robust game state management logic and using Socket.IO events to ensure instant updates across all connected clients.
Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
In five years, I see myself as a skilled software engineer leading projects, mentoring juniors, and contributing to impactful products.
Explain any one Data Structure.
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows FIFO—First In, First Out. It is used in scheduling, buffering, and handling real‑time tasks.
Do you have any questions for us?
Yes, I would like to know more about the team structure, the technologies I will work with, and opportunities for learning and growth.
